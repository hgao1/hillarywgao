      Hi, <br>
      I'm a former undergraduate of Physics and Art History at NYU (class of 2020).<br>
      In the past, I've worked with Professor David Grier in acoustic holography, Central Park with sculpture conservation, and Professor Bud Mishra with COVID19 simulations.<br>
      I'm particularly passionate about merging physics and art with a bend towards applications of science that help others.<br>
      In addition to that, I'm also interested in performance art, pushing the boundaries of responsibilities between performers / audience members, and just performance theory. <br>
      I currently work at a soft matter start-up, but you can find me in my free time building robots (to monitor feral cats), riding my bike around Brooklyn, and falling asleep to movies.
