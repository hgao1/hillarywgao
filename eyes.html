      <div class="caption">
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">A naked performer walks onto the stage, wheeling a cart. She faces the audience, smiles,
        and begins to mutilate her body—narrating to the audience as if it was a carnival show. <a href= "https://nyuskirball.org/events/florentina-holzinger-apollon/" target="_blank" style="color: #570b61">Apollon</a>,
        reduced, can be thought of as a piece that explores relationships. To name a few: between
        performer and audience—addressing the audience directly; between the performers themselves
        —catapulting one dancer to hit the other; between the audience members—side-looks and
        giggles; and between the art and society—drawing upon a rich history of feminist body art. Such
        an exploration must consider the audience, whoever and whatever comprises it. It is this
        questioning of relationships that Bishop, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/0162287042379810" target="_blank" style="color: #570b61"> Antagonism</a>, and Lepecki, in <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Singularities-Dance-in-the-Age-of-Performance/Lepecki/p/book/9781138907713" target="_blank" style="color: #570b61"> Singularities</a>,
        investigate.

            <div class='my-container' style="display:none;">
              Bishop examines the relationship between art and the audience by critiquing Bourriaud’s
                  theory of Relational Aesthetics. Bourriaud depicts Relational Aesthetics as the interaction
                  between audience members within a constructed social experience, such as a soup dinner, which
                  shifts the art from an object to an experience.<sup>1</sup> An experience Bishop calls a “microtopian.” In
                  Antagonism, she highlights many issues with the concept—but by questioning what types of
                  relationships are produced, Bishop comes to the thought that conflict, division, and antagonism
                  not only reflect our reality but provoke contemplation. Florentina Holzinger, undeniably, thinks
                  so as well. A performer urinates and defecates into beautiful glass jars; the feces later used as a
                  snack or as an object to fling at the audience. This freakshow quality is something done to
                  amuse. However, audience members still flee the theatre, others wince in their seats, wondering
                  why they came. It provokes under the guise of entertaining.</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black;text-indent: 40px">Of course, Apollon is also antagonistic on a deeper level. Two naked women stand on
                  pointe for what feels like ten minutes, a reference to Balanchine’s Apollo. When juxtaposed with
                  farcical, “wild west” scenes, these moments ask the audience to question the elite quality of
                  ballet. Holzinger asks us to reassign the value of ballet when it is grouped with the slap-stick,
                  vaudeville comedy. Bishop points to the uncomfortable, difficult work, as what can “[distance]
                  our thoughts from the predominant and preexisting consensus,” to reconsider implicit norms.2
                  The physical harm and presentation of the body further subvert audience expectations about
                  theatre. All performers are naked women going through varying forms of body harm—dance on
                  pointe, sticking needles into their arms, “sawing off” one’s leg. Body harm is a concept familiar
                  to body art, particularly feminist body art. In which the artist asks the audience to evaluate their
                  expectations of entertainment. Nudity is okay, but is self-mutilation? And if not, why not?
                  Violence is pervasive in media, deemed entertainment. But does a woman slowly pulling nails
                  out from her head, blood trickling down, also entertain? Holzinger further asks the audience to
                  reconsider what we find entertaining as Apollon descends into a violent farce, galloping into a
                  ‘bear trap,’ a dancer sawing off her leg. She challenges the audience, asking why not?</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Lepecki, in Singularities, highlights these qualities that Holzinger uses to ask “why not?”
                  and deems them tools that make dance powerful in subverting neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is a
                  theory of unregularized markets that, in turn, creates an environment of competition and
                  individualization. It seeps into all areas of life, especially art. Neoliberalism shows up in the form
                  of freelance artists, social media marketing, and even audience expectations: through a concept
                  of a “return on investment”. Artists must ‘invest’ in themselves, market themselves. Theatre,
                  competing with film and television for the audience’s attention, must also give a return: an
                  enjoyable, profound, moving experience. Or else, it is written off as a waste of time.</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Dance, with its “ephemerality, corporeality, precariousness, scoring, performativity, and
                  performance of affective labor,” subverts neoliberalism.<sup>3</sup> Specifically, ephemerality gives the
                  performance a “messianic dimension.” <sup>4</sup> Apollon, with its intensity and frenzy—sometimes many
                  different things happening at once—has a fervent dimension commonly associated with religion
                  and Messiahs, or gods. While its name references the god Apollo, the sexual references, fervor,
                  and performative aspect belong to Apollo’s counterpart, Dionysus. For art structured on the
                  physical body—corporeality—one suddenly sees “dance” as a craft revolving around body
                  mutilation and pain. Furthermore, this is a direct contradiction to the idea of a “return on the
                  self,” especially in front of paying audience members, many of whom left and never came back.
                  Apollon further utilizes the precariousness of bodies— while pointe work and scoring have a
                  disciplined element, Apollon presents these elements in a precarious nature, the pointe dancers
                  lacking correct technique. This precariousness becomes a choreography of “disciplined bodies”
                  to investigate the agency of the art and the relationship between the art and the audience’s
                  expectation. Performativity—presented as the “freak show”—fulfills the contract and promise of
                  entertainment to a point where the audience no longer wants to be entertained, and the affective
                  labor functions to provoke the audience into reconsidering their expectations.</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Lepecki says at one point that “performativity in choreography demonstrates that what
                  matters is not meaning-making, but ‘who is the master’.” <sup>5</sup> Looking at Apollon through this
                  statement, it is unclear who is the ‘master.’ Are the artists and performers themselves the
                  ‘master,’ choosing to hurt themselves, to perform vulnerable and nude? Is it the audience, whose
                  reactions and critiques can determine if Holzinger is invited back? For non-antagonizing,
                  American theatre, it should be the audience, with our expectation of “getting something” from a
                  performance. The paying audience determines the trend, what is popular, and therefore is the
                  “master” in controlling whether certain pieces gain popularity or whether pieces flop. Holzinger
                  knows that but does not care. Apollon is a challenge for audience members to stay, to stomach
                  the shock, horror, disgust, and to go back and work through the experience. And in that way, the
                  artists and performers become the masters, the timekeepers, ones who choose what to display.</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">At first glance, these two authors are writing about seemingly different topics. Bishop
                  advocates for conflict, for antagonizing the audience, for the eradication of microtopian
                  situations. Lepecki argues that dance is the ideal art that goes against neoliberalism, due to the
                  combination of various qualities intrinsic to the craft. However, both question a relationship
                  between participants, like audience members, and established norms. These norms and
                  preconceptions form a framework, sometimes unrecognized, that audience members carry with
                  them, what makes them label art as “good” or “bad,” “impactful” or “a waste of time.” Then,
                  what does it mean for Skirball to challenge these frameworks?</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">On Skirball’s website, it states its mission is to “present work that inspires yet frustrates,
                  confirms yet confounds, entertains yet upends.”<sup>6</sup> This mission could very well be Holzinger’s
                  intention for Apollon. With a history of curating performances that are progressive, experimental,
                  Skirball does not adhere to the expectation that audience members are to be entertained. In an
                  age of film and television, there is an intention of displaying stories with a strong sense of
                  realism and a three-act storyline designed to capture an audience’s attention. Skirball does curate
                  pieces that fail by these standards—pieces that antagonize the audience, ask them to rethink an
                  assumption. In order to do so, audience members are bored, disgusted, terrified, but most
                  importantly, expected to work in order to understand a piece. No audience has a unanimous
                  opinion on the performance: While Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker had a standing ovation, many
                  people were itching to leave their seats. Half the audience fled Apollon; the other half bound to
                  their seats. Some people found Eraser Mountain excruciatingly dull, while others returned a
                  second time to see it. There is a dissonance among crowd consensus. But this dissonance even
                  resides within the individual perspective.</p><br>
                  <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">There is no doubt that Apollon is successful in being antagonistic and defying neoliberal
                  policies in order to challenge structures and orders that modern viewers are subscribed to. Yet,
                  upon reflection, it must be asked if there is a limit. Is there a limit to where the violence is so
                  overwhelming, so in your face, that the entire message is cheapened? What happens if the
                  subsequent conversations revolve around a fascination with the grotesque qualities of the
                  performance but not the message? Is there a limit where the boredom of Eraser Mountain is so
                  insurmountable, that the audience member just gives up? If so, should curators evaluate a piece
                  by what an audience is supposed to get from it? By doing so, art becomes another slave to
                  Neoliberalism. Yet, is there a point in curating such pieces that leave audiences with a feeling of
                  alienation? But also, what does it mean to create art that pushes audiences when it is limited in
                  this way? These questions ask how to curate subversive art within a system, an institution that is
                  all-encompassing, deeply embedded in our culture and ways of thinking. It is a question that,
                  similar to Bishop and Lepecki, asks for a re-evaluation of the structures already present and
                  agreed upon.</p><br>

        <b> Feb 15th,2020 (NYU Skirball): Mitten Wir Im Leben Sind </b>
      </div>
      <div class="caption">
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Let us define spacetime as four independent components: time, x-position, y-position, z-
        position. Instead of laboring in 3D space, spacetime allows an engagement with a fourth dimension, time. Time becomes a new constraint, something that can be rushed or dragged out
        over long moments. Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s Mitten Wir Im Leben Sind operates in
        spacetime. She creates a two-hour experience without intermission, inviting observers into a
        tension-filled environment that deviates from the outside world, where the constraints of
        spacetime and all subjects enclosed are created, broken, and put back together.</p><br>
        <div class="tp-caption rev-btn rev-hiddenicon rs-hover-ready rev-mre-btn button-open-container">
          <span class='my-text'><div class="boxSmall">READ MORE:</div></span>
          <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">

            <div class='my-container' style="display:none;">
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Within the first half, she creates constraints on spacetime as rules for her world. Time,
        and therefore movement, only runs when music is playing—moments of abrupt silence means
        the dancers must pause, frozen and tense. The spike tape-creation of a geometric shape in silence
        is conveyed as just setting up, frozen time. Topography and boundaries of the x, y, and z position
        are defined by bodies—hitting the back wall, standing at the front, jumping. The allowed space
        for motion is meticulously mapped out, with the geometrical shapes as an initial boundary. Duets
        between dancers explore a geometry that Anne Teresa signals at the beginning of each suite—
        triangle, square. For the triangle, dancers seem to carry weight on their shoulders, eluding to the
        architectural theory that triangles, the strongest shape, carry the most weight. During the square,
        a shape with equal side lengths, the dancers carry each other and shift their weights equally
        between the man and woman. The tension no longer resides individually, but between partners. </p><br>
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Let us define the relationships between the dancers, musicians, and the audience within
        Anne Teresa’s world. Between the dancers, the first rule is the performance of a solo, followed
        by a duet with Anne Teresa. The cellist and dancers have a symbiotic relationship: the dancers
        set up the stool for the cellist to play, the cellist begins the performance time. The dancers and
        cellist converse—at some moments it seems as though the cellist is pushing and pulling the
        dancer, but at other moments, the dancers are dominant. This rigid bind between music and
        dance comes from Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker’s decision to use Bach’s Cello Suites. With a
        history of choreographing to music already made, she creates a rule of rigid accompaniment
        where dancers move with the music and freeze with silence. By exploring Bach’s Cello Suites
        through movements that accompany both harmonic and discordant phrases, Anne Teresa builds
        up tension through restriction. The dancers address the audience through glances and frontal
        facing. Anne Teresa furthers this line of communication with the audience by signaling to them
        the number and geometry at the beginning of each suite. Furthermore, each suite has an ending
        with an expected response: the cellist and dancers finish, and the audience claps. Setting up of
        these rules allows one to feel a tension akin to waiting for the expected and the gratifying
        catharsis of predicting correctly. These boundaries and set relationships allow us to naively
        believe we can predict the last half.<br>
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Let us define subversion as the undermining of the established system. In the fourth suite,
        the cellist pauses mid-phrase. The rules dictate that the dancers must stop, time and space must
        freeze, and yet, it does not happen. The dancers continue to move across the stage as if they
        missed a major cue. The tension from our expectations, from the restrictions and boundaries
        imposed by the rules, mounts and we begin to watch Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker break down
        her four-dimensional spacetime.<br>
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Spacetime components no longer have the same rigidity as before. Time moves at
        different speeds without rules. It rushes with a dancer’s leaps and repetitive motions, but also
        slowly drags on, oozing, as a dancer lays on the ground, heavily dragging his body back and
        forth. With or without music or virtuosic dance moves, performance time still goes on. This
        subverts the expectation of what constitutes as dance performance. The dance becomes the
        laying out of tape rather than pirouettes. It becomes the performer lying motionless on the stage.
        It becomes Anne Teresa walking across the stage pedestrianly. Motion no longer requires the
        breadth of the entire stage. The dancer’s range can occupy a space as small as a man’s body. The
        space is no longer limited to two or three bodies but can expand to fit five.<br>
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Relationships between participants—dancers, musician, audience—are further subverted.
        The dancers and the music lose their rigid codependence. At one point, the musician stops
        abruptly, takes his chair, and leaves the stage as the dancers continue. Anne Teresa signals the
        fifth suite as an explosion, but dancers are absent during the suite, and we are left with the music.
        We wait in tense anticipation, hoping for our expected end. We wait similarly when we watch
        the dancer motionless on the floor. It is the tension of our hands poised, itching to clap, but the
        performance no longer gratifies us with a definite ending.<br>
        <p style="color: black; text-indent: 40px">Spacetime and all its relationships are muddled, we are misled, and our expectations are
        subverted. This is not a phenomenon unique to this performance, as critics have described Anne
        Teresa’s approach to movement as “wringing possibilities from a narrow set of steps; building
        rigid structures from which, somehow, emotion could blossom...”.<sup>1</sup> Although such rigidity
        results in a blossoming or an explosion, it still is not a catharsis. Tension prevails until Anne
        Teresa releases us. Without any remaining expectations, she rapidly builds back up her world
        and conditions: all the dancers are on stage, performing movements from their solos and duets in
        tandem. They take control of spacetime. The subversion and reversion of rules resolves our
        tension, and allows for an equality between all participants.<br>
